Seshat
======

Welcome to Seshat! You are about to enter the wonderful world of eBook and Audiobook syncing.

When it comes to using Seshat, it's quite simple. Load in an eBook in the ePub format, and audio files using either a chapter structure (e.g. one file per chapter) or one file for the whole book. Unfortunately we are not able to support any other formats right now, or alternate file structures for the audio.

When you've loaded in the files you'll be able to create a timings file using speech recognition, estimation or manually. When a timings file has been created you'll see two buttons have become availible for you to use. One is the \"Sync Audio\" button and the other is \"Sync Book\". These both work similarly, but in very different ways.

To use \"Sync Audio\" simply select a sentence or passage in the text and click it to have the approximately appropriate location be synced up in the audio file. In essence, start listening from the spot you select to sync from.

To use \"Sync Book\", simply press it after you've listened to the file. It will then find the location in the text, based on the time of your player. Precision will again vary from book to book, but should in general be good.

Thank you for using Seshat!
